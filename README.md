### TDD Design Software Technique

This is a practice of the course Node.js of LaunchX where we design a solution applying Test-Driven Development following three simple steps repeatedly:

1. Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
2. Write the functional code until the test passes.
3. Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.
